Only the default `spotlight.html` and the [mobile view on desktop screens](mobile view on desktop screens/spotlight.html) are ready to use the custom api for now. 
I know some issues are persisting, but I'm too lazy to fix them (I hope to fix them someday; if I don't, please feel free to make a pr if you need to fix it). 
I made this modification for my own use, so I may not be able to help you. 
Don't trust my code; I recommend making the same modifications on your own.
If you really want to reproduce my setup, I use Jellyfin (from the repository) with an Nginx proxy to sort on the same URL. ([nginx configuration](nginx/default-nginx))
